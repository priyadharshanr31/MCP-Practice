# MCP-Practice

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server implemented in Python for learning, experimentation, and integration with AI models. This project is a playground to explore how AI assistants like Claude or ChatGPT can interact with external tools and data via MCP.

## üß† What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a framework that allows AI models to interact securely and effectively with external tools, services, or datasets by sending standardized requests and receiving structured responses. MCP acts as a bridge between an AI assistant and a developer-defined server.
